# Pivot guide

The pivot engine turns any table of any pack, or the VaR engine's trades, into a pivot: these measures, broken down by these fields on
rows and columns, under these filters, on this business date. Every figure is computed by the server; every total is made from its own
members, never from the figures on the screen. The design behind it is [PIVOT_ENGINE.md](../architecture/PIVOT_ENGINE.md); the hands-on
walk-through is [tutorial 33](../tutorials/33-the-pivot-engine.md).

## 1. Open it

| From | How |
|---|---|
| The command line | `PIVOT <GO>` (choose a source), `PIVOT trade <GO>` (a table), `PIVOT trade 2026-10-30 <GO>` (a table on a date), `PIVOT var <GO>` (VaR), `PIVOT @asha/desk-risk <GO>` (a saved view) |
| The menu | **Views → Pivot** |
| A table | **Pivot** in the Data view's facts of the table (`DATA trade <GO>`, then Pivot) |

The engine is a switch: `drishti.pivot.enabled` (default on). Off, `/api/v1/pivot` answers `404 DRS-5703` in words and the Pivot tab of
Sutras is hidden too (the two share the switch).

## 2. The screen

The screen is mock-up A of the design ([section 25](../architecture/PIVOT_ENGINE.md#25-mock-ups-the-screens-to-build)): Excel's PivotTable
as people know it, with what Excel lacks in the places Excel's equivalents would be.

| Part | What it does |
|---|---|
| Toolbar | Source, Date, Compare (another date, cell by cell), Subtotals (below or above), Chart (`G`), Export (`X`), Save view, Share |
| Scan-estimate bar | what the view reads before it runs ("This pivot reads ≈2,000 rows (≈94 KB, 3 of 8 columns), ≈under a second."); a large one asks first, with **Run** |
| The grid | rows in display order: a member with **+** (closed) or a header with **−** (open), its children indented, then its total (subtotals below; above puts the total on the member's own line); Others; the grand total. Columns × measures; a holistic measure's header carries **H**, an approximate figure **≈** |
| Fields | every field you may use, with its type (string, date, number), and the source's own measures (VaR, ES); search with `/` |
| Four zones | Filters, Columns, Rows, Values. Drag a field onto a zone, or select it and press `R`, `C`, `V` or `F`; double-click puts a number into Values and a text into Rows. A value's chip has a function picker (sum, count, avg, min, max, median, count_distinct, var_samp, stddev_samp) |
| Provenance popover | click a cell: its figure, exact or ≈, the function and how its totals are made, the members counted, the condition (or VaR scope) that selects them, the data version, the filters, what was computed and what came from the cache, its reference; **Rows** lists the members, **Ask the VaR engine** opens the cell's scope in VAR |
| Chart | a chart of the selected cells (or the top level), linked to the grid: a click on a bar opens that member |
| Export | what (the pivot, the rows of the selected cell, the definition) and how (Excel, CSV, Arrow) |

Keyboard: arrows move between cells; `→` on a row's first cell opens it, `←` closes it; `Shift+→` opens every level below; `1` to `9`
opens the whole row axis to that level; `E` expands the selected row by another field; `Enter` lists a cell's rows; `G` charts; `X`
exports. The help line under the grid shows them.

## 3. Sources and fields

| Source | What it is | Its fields | Its measures |
|---|---|---|---|
| A table (`trade`, `position`, any stored kind) | the Data view's table, read for you through its connector on the date | its columns, typed from the data contract (`string`, `date`, `number`) | the built-in functions over any field |
| `var` | the VaR engine's book of the date | the positions' text columns (DESK, CURRENCY, PRODUCT_GROUP …) | `var()`, `es()`, `pv()`, `trades()` |

A date field groups as `TRADE_DATE:day`, `:week`, `:month`, `:quarter` or `:year`; a number as `NOTIONAL_USD:width=1000000` (buckets of a
width, labelled by their lower edge). A missing value is the member `(blank)`.

A table is read once per date, data version and mask signature and kept in the engine's in-memory DuckDB (`drishti.pivot.stage-keep`
tables); a table over `drishti.pivot.stage-max-rows` rows is refused in words, never cut short. Memory-only data is never written: the
executor has no spill folder unless `drishti.pivot.duckdb.temp-directory` names one.

## 4. Measures and how each total is made

**A cell or a total is made from its members, never from other cells' figures.** What differs by kind is how:

| Function | Kind | A total is | In Excel |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sum(x)` | mergeable | the sum of its own rows (compensated) | `SUM` of its parts |
| `count()`, `count(x)` | mergeable | the rows (or values) of its own rows | `SUM` of its parts |
| `avg(x)` | mergeable | Σx / n of its own rows, never an average of averages | value |
| `min(x)`, `max(x)` | mergeable | the extreme of its own rows | value |
| `wavg(x, w)` | mergeable | Σwx / Σw of its own rows | value |
| `var_samp(x)`, `var_pop(x)`, `stddev_samp(x)`, `stddev_pop(x)` | mergeable | Welford's state of its own rows | value |
| `median(x)`, `percentile(x, q)` | holistic, exact | the quantile of its own values (linear interpolation, as DuckDB's `quantile_cont`) | value |
| `count_distinct(x)` | holistic, exact | the distinct values of its own rows | value |
| `var()`, `es()` (source `var`) | holistic | the VaR engine's answer for the cell's own scope, from its trades' summed scenario vector | value |
| `pv()`, `trades()` (source `var`) | holistic (adds up) | the engine's answer for the cell's scope | value |

So the desks' VaRs add up to more than the bank's: the grand total is the bank's own VaR, and the gap (Σ children − total) is shown beside
every open node's total as **Σ−total**, the diversification. The sketch functions (≈ distinct counts and percentiles, exact on request) come
with phase P3; custom functions (DEL, SQL macros, Python, Java) with phase P2.

Show values as: a value may carry `showAs` (`pct-grand`, `pct-row`, `pct-column`, `pct-parent-row`, `rank`); it is computed from the
finished figures, so a total is never broken.

## 5. Nested rows, opened lazily

Rows are levels. Only level one is computed at first; opening a member computes **its children only**: one statement for that node's
children and their columns, every other cell read from the partial-state cache. A ten-level hierarchy over a big table opens as fast as one
level. The answer says what it did: "18 cells · 6 sets (4 from the cache) · 1 queries".

- **Expand by…** (`E`): open any member by a field other than the next row field, per member: EMEA by desk, APAC by currency, in one grid.
  The totals stay right: each node is its own cell key.
- **Open to level N** (`1`–`9`): every member down to level N.
- The open nodes are part of the view (its `expanded` list), so a saved view and a link reopen them.

## 6. Top N, Others and sorting

A level may show its top N members by a measure and one **Others** member: "Others (3 of 5)". Others' figures are computed from **its own
members** (the rows of the members not shown), for every measure: a median of Others is the median of those rows, never total minus the
top N. Others is not opened further (its rows can be exported).

Each level sorts on its own: by label in the field's type order (numbers by value, dates by time, text alphabetically, `(blank)` last),
or by a measure, ascending or descending. A sort never moves a child out of its parent.

## 7. Provenance, rows and cell references

Every answer has a provenance id (`pv:<date>:<hash>`); every cell's provenance (members, condition or scope, the measures' kinds, the data
version, filters, statements run, cache hits, time) is kept for the last `drishti.pivot.provenance-kept` answers.

**Rows** lists a cell's member rows, paged, as you may see them (the VaR source's rows are its trades: open the cell's scope in VAR).

A **cell reference** names a cell of a saved view by its coordinates, not its position: `pivot://asha/desk-risk@4/Notional[DESK=RATES-NY,
CCY=USD]`. It survives re-sorting, new columns and a new date; a coordinate that is gone says "not in the view", never 0. Copy it from the
popover; resolve it with `GET /api/v1/pivot/cells?ref=...`.

## 8. The scan estimate, budgets and busy protection

Before a view runs, the screen shows what it will read. Over `drishti.pivot.estimate.confirm-above-seconds` (60) or `confirm-above-rows`
(500 million), it asks first. A table not yet read for you has an unknown size until its first pivot.

- **Cell budget**: a view of more visible cells than `drishti.pivot.max-cells` (20,000, totals included; `max-holistic-cells`, 5,000,
  with a holistic measure) is refused with the count and how to narrow it (`422 DRS-5702`), never cut short.
- **Busy protection**: a view of more than `drishti.pivot.busy-cells` cells asks the admission gate before it opens deeper levels; a
  refusal is `503 DRS-9507` with `Retry-After`.

## 9. Charts of a selection

Select cells (click, Shift+click or Shift+arrows) and press `G`. With nothing selected the chart shows the top level. A measure that adds up
(sum, count) is drawn as bars that sum to the total. **A measure that does not add up is never stacked**: VaR by desk is drawn as the desks'
bars beside the bank's, with the diversification as its own bar, and the chart says so in words. A bar's click opens that member in the
grid. ECharts is vendored; nothing comes from a CDN.

## 10. Export

**Export** (`X`) asks what and how:

| What | Contents |
|---|---|
| The pivot as shown | Excel: one sheet with the rows as shown, numbers as numbers, Excel's own row **outline levels** (grouping with + and −, summaries below or above as on screen); a **`SUM` formula only where a measure's total is the plain sum of its parts** (sum, count), every other figure the engine's value; a **Provenance** sheet (who, when, the provenance id, the data, the filters, every measure's function, kind, exactness and how its totals are made). CSV: one row per cell and measure (`ROW, COLUMN, <dimensions>, MEASURE, VALUE, EXACT, MEMBERS, KIND`) or the grid as shown. Arrow: the cells as a columnar stream |
| The underlying rows | the selected cell's member rows as CSV, as you may see them (up to `drishti.pivot.export.rows-max`) |
| The definition | the view as YAML, no figures |

An xlsx of more rows than `drishti.pivot.export.xlsx-max-rows` is refused with CSV or Arrow offered. Every export is audited (who, the view,
what, the format, the size), never its values.

## 11. Saved and shared views, compare

**Save view** keeps the definition (never the numbers) under your name, each save a new version; **Share** adds people or roles
(`role:risk`). A reader opens a shared view with their own entitlements and masks. `PIVOT @owner/name <GO>` opens one.

**Compare** picks another date: each cell shows its change (▲/▼) and new or gone cells are marked; the API answers both sides and the
differences.

## 12. Who sees what

- A table is read through the Data view's own read for you: a table you may not open is not offered; a **masked column is not read at
  all**, so it cannot be a dimension, a measure's input or a filter (`403 DRS-5705`).
- The VaR source applies the VaR engine's own entitlements: trades you may not see are left out of every cell; a role that sees the bank only
  in aggregate is offered no dimension (hierarchy levels come with the MR cube).
- `drishti.pivot.aggregate-only.min-members-per-cell` (1 as shipped) hides the figures of a cell with fewer members.
- Every view run, rows read and export is audited without values.

## 13. The view as JSON

```json
{ "source": "trade", "date": "2026-10-30",
  "rows": ["LEGAL_ENTITY", "DESK"], "columns": ["TRADE_DATE:month"],
  "values": [{"measure": "sum(NOTIONAL_USD)", "as": "Notional"}, {"measure": "median(PNL_1D)", "as": "Median P&L"}],
  "filters": {"PRODUCT_GROUP": {"in": ["RATES", "FX"]}, "TRADE_STATUS": {"notIn": ["MATURED"]}},
  "expanded": [{"axis": "rows", "path": [["LEGAL_ENTITY", "LE-UK"]], "by": "CURRENCY"}],
  "expandTo": {"rows": 1}, "sort": {"DESK": {"by": "Notional", "desc": true}},
  "top": {"DESK": {"n": 10, "by": "Notional"}}, "subtotals": "below" }
```

The answer has `rows` and `columns` in display order (each with `key`, `kind` node, header, total, others or grand, `depth`, `label`,
`path`, `expandable`, `expanded`, `by`, and `diversification` on a holistic total), `cells` keyed `rowKey|colKey` (each with `values`,
`members`, `coords`, `notes` where a figure is missing, `scope` on the VaR source), `measures` (id, label, kind, plainSum, exact),
`computed` (sets, fromCache, queries, ms), `provenance` and `provenanceShared`.

## 14. The API

| Call | Does |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/pivot/sources` | the sources you may pivot |
| `GET /api/v1/pivot/catalogue?source=&date=` | a source's fields, measures, functions, dates, masked count |
| `POST /api/v1/pivot/query` | a view (or `{"view": "owner/name"}`) → its answer |
| `POST /api/v1/pivot/estimate` | the scan estimate; nothing read |
| `POST /api/v1/pivot/expand` | `{view, axis, path, by}`: the view with that node open; only its children computed |
| `POST /api/v1/pivot/compare` | `{view, otherDate}`: both answers and the differences per cell |
| `POST /api/v1/pivot/rows` | `{view, coords, offset, limit}`: a cell's member rows |
| `GET /api/v1/pivot/cells?ref=` | a cell by reference |
| `GET /api/v1/pivot/provenance/{id}?cell=rowKey|colKey` | an answer's or a cell's provenance |

More in [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md#516-pivot).

## 16. Settings

All under `drishti.pivot` in `application.yaml`, listed in [CONFIGURATION.md](../admin/CONFIGURATION.md): `enabled`, `max-cells`,
`max-holistic-cells`, `busy-cells`, `cache-mb` (the partial-state cache `pivot.states`, in the one memory budget), `provenance-kept`,
`local-shards`, `stage-max-rows`, `stage-keep`, `duckdb.connections`, `duckdb.threads`, `duckdb.memory-limit-mb`, `duckdb.temp-directory`,

`export.rows-max`; and `drishti.admission.retry-after.pivot-view`.

## 17. Refusals and their codes

| Code | Status | When |
|---|---|---|
| DRS-5701 | 400 | a view it cannot answer: an unknown field or function, a field twice, a bad grouping, sort or show-as |
| DRS-5702 | 422 | over the cell budget (with the count), a table over `stage-max-rows`, an xlsx over `xlsx-max-rows` |
| DRS-5703 | 404 | the engine is switched off here |
| DRS-5704 | 404 | a saved view, provenance id or source that is not there (or not shared with you) |
| DRS-5705 | 403 | a masked field asked as a dimension, input or filter |
| DRS-9507 | 503 | busy protection: a large view did not start; `Retry-After` |

## 18. How it is built

The engine is the Maven module `drishti-bicompute` (plain Java, no Spring): the pivot model (views, cell keys, nested axes), the provider
SPI (`PivotProvider`: catalogue, estimate, evaluate a plan of declarative cell sets into partial states, drill), the function SPI
(`AggFunction`: start, add a columnar batch, merge, finish; mergeable, sketch or holistic; each with its SQL state form), the built-ins,
the `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS` compiler and the DuckDB tabular provider, partial states merged in a fixed order (`OrderedMerge`), the
partial-state cache, the split-and-merge harness and the exports. The server wires it: the Data view's tables as sources, the VaR provider,
REST, busy protection, saved views and audit. The console only draws.
